Step 1: POST : power on Self Test
Step 2: BIOS : booting of the bios programs
Step 3: MBR : Master book record gets loaded
Step 4: GRUB : Stage 1 Of os boot loader gets performed
Step 5: /boot : directory gets mapped
Step 6: GRUB (/boot/grub/grub.conf) : gets booted from this script
Step 7: Kernel initialised(/boot/vmlinux/) : this file gets loaded
Step 8: /(root) : root file system gets mapped
Step 9: init 1 : init process get initialised in Emergency mode(PID=1)
Step 10: /etc/inittab : this service gets started
Step 11: Sysinit : system get's initialized
Step 12: OS runs in Single User MOde
Step 13: OS runs in init level 5

Init RUN Levels:
init 0 : Shutdown (goes thru the /etc/rc0.d/* scripts then halts)
init 1 : Single user mode or emergency mode means no network no multitasking is present in this mode only root has access in this runlevel
init 2 : No network but multitasking support is present .
init 3 : Network is present multitasking is present but without GUI .
init 4 : It is similar to runlevel 3; It is reserved for other purposes in research.
init 5 : Network is present multitasking and GUI is present with sound etc.
init 6 : This runlevel is defined to system restart.
init s : Tells the init command to enter the maintenance mode. When the
system enters maintenance mode from another run level, only the system console
is used as the terminal.
init S : Same as init s.
init m : Same as init s and init S.
init M : Same as init s or init S or init m.


How to check run level?
-> runlevel

location where runlevel are defined:
/etc/rc.d/
S : start using this file
K : when kernel shutdown it uses this filename starting with K

Config files
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

How to find failed services:
/var/logs


How to create new user in centos
-> sudo adduser username
how to add password for the new user
-> sudo passwd username
if we want to give administrative rights to newly created user
